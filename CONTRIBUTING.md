## How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

- **Bug Fixes**: Fix issues reported in GitHub Issues
- **Features**: Add new functionality or enhance existing features
- **Documentation**: Improve or add documentation
- **Tests**: Add missing tests or improve test coverage
- **Performance**: Optimize code for better performance
- **Refactoring**: Improve code quality without changing functionality

### Before You Start

1. Check if an issue already exists for your contribution
2. For major changes, open an issue first to discuss
3. Ensure your idea aligns with the project's goals

## Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Go 1.20 or higher
- Git
- Make (optional but recommended)

### Setting Up Your Environment

1. **Install Go** from [golang.org](https://golang.org/dl/)

2. **Install development tools**:
   ```bash
   make install-tools
   ```
   
   Or manually:
   ```bash
   go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/goimports@latest
   go install github.com/securego/gosec/v2/cmd/gosec@latest
   curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/golangci/golangci-lint/master/install.sh | sh -s -- -b $(go env GOPATH)/bin
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   make deps
   ```
   
   Or:
   ```bash
   go mod download
   ```

4. **Run tests to verify setup**:
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

## Coding Standards

### Go Code Style

- Follow the [Go Code Review Comments](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/CodeReviewComments)
- Use `gofmt` and `goimports` for formatting:
  ```bash
  make fmt
  ```
- Follow naming conventions:
  - Exported names start with capital letters
  - Acronyms should be all caps (HTTP, TCP, RTU)
  - Use descriptive variable names

### Project-Specific Guidelines

1. **Error Handling**:
   ```go
   // Good
   if err != nil {
       return nil, fmt.Errorf("failed to read registers: %w", err)
   }
   
   // Bad
   if err != nil {
       return nil, err
   }
   ```

2. **Type Safety**:
   ```go
   // Good
   var address modbus.Address = 100
   
   // Bad
   var address uint16 = 100
   ```

3. **Constants**:
   - Define protocol constants in `modbus/constants.go`
   - Group related constants together
   - Add comments for non-obvious values

4. **Documentation**:
   - All exported types and functions must have comments
   - Comments should start with the name being declared
   - Include examples for complex functions

### Linting

Run linters before committing:

```bash
make lint
```

Fix common issues:
- Unused variables and imports
- Error handling
- Code complexity
- Security issues

## Testing Guidelines

### Test Requirements

- All new features must include tests
- Bug fixes should include regression tests
- Maintain or improve test coverage

### Types of Tests

1. **Unit Tests**:
   ```go
   func TestReadHoldingRegisters(t *testing.T) {
       // Test implementation
   }
   ```

2. **Integration Tests**:
   ```go
   // +build integration
   
   func TestClientServerIntegration(t *testing.T) {
       // Integration test
   }
   ```

3. **Benchmarks**:
   ```go
   func BenchmarkReadRegisters(b *testing.B) {
       // Benchmark implementation
   }
   ```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
make test

# Run with coverage
make coverage

# Run benchmarks
make bench

# Run specific tests
go test -run TestReadCoils ./...
```

### Test Best Practices

- Use table-driven tests for multiple scenarios
- Test error cases and edge conditions
- Use mock interfaces for external dependencies
- Keep tests focused and independent
- Use meaningful test names

## Commit Messages

Follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) specification:

### Format

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>

<body>

<footer>
```

### Types

- **feat**: New feature
- **fix**: Bug fix
- **docs**: Documentation changes
- **style**: Code style changes (formatting, etc.)
- **refactor**: Code refactoring
- **test**: Test additions or changes
- **perf**: Performance improvements
- **chore**: Maintenance tasks

### Examples

```bash
feat(client): add support for RTU over TCP

Implements RTU over TCP transport as specified in the
MODBUS specification. This allows RTU frame format to
be used over TCP/IP networks.

Closes #123
```

```bash
fix(server): correct CRC calculation for RTU frames

The CRC was being calculated with bytes in wrong order.
This fix ensures proper byte ordering as per specification.
```

## Pull Request Process

### Before Submitting

1. **Update your branch**:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git rebase upstream/main
   ```

2. **Run checks**:
   ```bash
   make pre-commit
   ```
   
   This runs:
   - Formatting checks
   - Linting
   - Tests
   - Vet

3. **Update documentation** if needed

4. **Add tests** for your changes

### Submitting a Pull Request

1. **Push your changes**:
